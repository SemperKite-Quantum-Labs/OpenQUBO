# OpenQUBO

OpenQUBO is a unified QUBO and Ising processing, analysis, and visualization
platform for gate-based quantum, quantum annealing, and hybrid
quantum-classical optimization workflows.

It provides an integrated environment for constructing, validating,
and analyzing quadratic optimization models, visualizing interaction
structures, evaluating energy landscapes, and exporting solver-ready
implementations for deployment across classical and quantum backends.

- Support for gate-based, annealing-based, and hybrid workflows
- NumPy (.npy) matrix import and export
- Structured JSON export for analysis reports and solver pipelines
- Coupling graph and interaction visualization
- Energy evaluation and landscape analysis
- Backend code generation (QAOA, annealing, classical solvers)
- Local execution as a Windows desktop application
